# Weather App 

This is a Weather Dashboard built with HTML,CSS, Javascript, and the OpenWeatherMap API -- https://openweathermap.org/api

The app takes a city as an input, and once the search button is pressed displays the current weather forecast and a 5 day forecast.

The search history is saved, and cleared either when the page first loads, reloads, or if the clear button is pressed.

Check it out live at - https://ryanjms.github.io/weatherApp_hw6/
