## Description

This is a Weather Dashboard built with HTML,CSS, Javascript, and the OpenWeatherMap API -- https://openweathermap.org/api

The app takes a city as an input, and once the search button is pressed displays the current weather forecast and a 5 day forecast.

The search history is saved, and cleared either when the page first loads, reloads, or if the clear button is pressed.

## Installation

## Usage

Search for a city, and it will display the date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV Index, as well as a 5 day forecast.
